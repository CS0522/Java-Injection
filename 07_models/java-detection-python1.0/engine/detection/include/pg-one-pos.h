 * Array giving the position of the left-most set bit for each possible

 * left-most the 7th bit.  The 0th entry of the array should not be used.
 *
 * Note: this is not used by the functions in pg_bitutils.h when
 * HAVE__BUILTIN_CLZ is defined, but we provide it anyway, so that
 * extensions possibly compiled with a different compiler can use it.
