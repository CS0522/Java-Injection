<p>This document contains the release notes for
                <strong>Version 1.0-beta-1</strong>
                of the Struts Framework.
                The following sections cover
                <a href="#New">New Features</a>
                and
                <a href="#Changes">Changes</a>
                since
                the
                <strong>Version 0.5</strong>
                of Struts was made available.
            </p>
<p>One global new feature to take note of is that Struts 1.0
                requires
                a Java2 (JDK 1.2 or later) platform on which to run.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2><a name="Whats_New"></a>What's New?</h2>
<p>The following major new features have been added to the
                controller
                servlet and associated classes
                (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.action</code>
                ):
            </p>
<ul><li>A new configuration file format, including the
                    <a href="../../dtds/struts-config_1_0.dtd">Document Type
                        Definition (DTD)</a>
                    it is based on, is available for configuring the Struts
                    controller
                    servlet. Support for the previous format is still present,
                    but will
                    be phased out by the 1.0 release.
                </li>
<li>If enabled by setting the
                    <code>locale</code>
                    servlet initialization
                    parameter to
                    <code>true</code>
                    , the controller servlet will now calculate
                    a Locale for this user (based on the Locale returned by
                    the servlet
                    container, or by the HTTP headers included with the
                    request)
                    and store it in the user's session, unless the application
                    has stored one there already.
                </li>
<li>Application
                    <code>Action</code>
                    instances now have lifecycle support.
                    The controller servlet will call
                    <code>setServlet()</code>
                    with a
                    non-null argument when the instance is first created, and
                    call it with
                    a
                    <code>null</code>
                    argument when the instance is being shut down.
                </li>
<li>The collection of &quot;standard&quot; Struts actions (in package
                    <code>org.apache.struts.actions</code>
                    ) is kicked off with a set of
                    simple actions that allow on-the-fly changes in the form
                    bean, forward,
                    and mapping definitions registered with the controller
                    servlet. These
                    actions would normally be configured behind security
                    constraints to
                    prevent interference with the operation of your
                    application but can be
                    very useful during development.
                </li>
<li>A new representation of error messages (
                    <code>ActionError</code>
                    and
                    <code>ActionErrors</code>
                    ) has been created that allows errors to be
                    associated with individual fields, and stores parameter
                    replacement
                    values along with the messages keys.
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>ActionForm</code>
                    interface has been converted to a base class,
                    with default implementations of some useful functionality.
                    In addition,
                    the new class provides two
                    <code>validate()</code>
                    methods that take
                    the current mapping and current request as arguments, in
                    order to provide
                    access to more context information than just the
                    properties of this
                    particular form bean.
                </li>
<li>The new
                    <code>ActionForm</code>
                    class also provides two
                    <code>reset()</code>
                    methods that take the current mapping and current
                    request as arguments, in order to provide access to more
                    context
                    information (particularly important on multi-page forms so
                    that the form
                    bean knows which properties to reset). Among other things,
                    use of the
                    <code>reset()</code>
                    methods can prevent problems with checkbox fields
                    -- simply reset boolean fields to
                    <code>false</code>
                    and they will be
                    set to
                    <code>true</code>
                    (during auto-population of the form bean
                    properties) only if the checkbox was actually checked.
                </li>
<li>All servlet context attributes created by the Struts
                    controller servlet
                    itself (but not the Struts Example application) now
                    implement
                    <code>java.io.Serializable</code>
                    .
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>Action</code>
                    class now includes support for &quot;transactional
                    tokens&quot;, so that you can detect cases where the user
                    submitted a form,
                    then went back and resubmitted the form again.
                </li>
</ul>
<p>The following major new features have been added to the
                <em>struts-bean</em>
                custom tag library (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.bean</code>
                ):
            </p>
<ul><li>A new custom tag,
                    <code>&lt;bean:page&gt;</code>
                    , is available
                    to expose key items from the page context associated with
                    the current
                    page as scripting variables, and as page-scope beans. For
                    example,
                    you can use the following sequence to render the server
                    information
                    string returned by our servlet context:
                    <pre>
                        &lt;bean:page id=&quot;app&quot; property=&quot;application&quot;/&gt;
                        &lt;bean:write name=&quot;app&quot; property=&quot;serverInfo&quot;/&gt;
                    </pre></li>
<li>A new custom tag,
                    <code>&lt;bean:struts&gt;</code>
                    , is available
                    to expose internal Struts configuration objects (form
                    bean, forward,
                    and mapping definitions) as scripting variables and
                    page-scope beans.
                    For example, you can use the following sequence to render
                    the actual
                    context-relative path of an
                    <code>ActionForward</code>
                    object:
                    <pre>
                        &lt;bean:struts id=&quot;link&quot; forward=&quot;success&quot;/&gt;
                        &lt;bean:write name=&quot;link&quot; property=&quot;path&quot;/&gt;
                    </pre></li>
<li>All of the tags in this library that accept a
                    <code>name</code>
                    attribute referring to a JSP bean now also accept an
                    optional
                    <code>scope</code>
                    attribute to define the scope in which to search
                    for that bean. If not specified, all scopes are searched.
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>&lt;bean:size&gt;</code>
                    tag will create a bean that stores
                    the number of elements of an array, Collection, or Map.
                </li>
</ul>
<p>The
                <em>struts-html</em>
                custom tag library has been created (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.html</code>
                ), based on the old tags that
                were related to HTML form presentation. The following
                differences from
                the old tags are notable:
            </p>
<ul><li>You must now reference the &quot;struts-html.tld&quot; TLD to access
                    these
                    tags.</li>
<li>All attribute names matching JavaScript event handlers are
                    now all
                    lower case (onClick --&gt; onclick) to conform to
                    XHTML.</li>
<li>The
                    <code>options1</code>
                    tag has been eliminated since Struts is now
                    based on Java2.
                </li>
<li>All tag implementation classes have had their
                    <code>final</code>
                    modifiers removed, and
                    <code>private</code>
                    instance variables
                    changed to
                    <code>protected</code>
                    . This makes it possible to easily
                    subclass these tags to provide specialized functionality.
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>&lt;html:link&gt;</code>
                    tag has been enhanced to support
                    a new
                    <code>page</code>
                    attribute that allows you to use
                    context-relative URIs in a portable manner.
                </li>
<li>A new
                    <code>&lt;html:html&gt;</code>
                    tag has been created that
                    renders an HTML
                    <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>
                    element with appropriate
                    <code>lang</code>
                    and
                    <code>xml:lang</code>
                    attributes, based on the
                    locale stored for the user's session (if there is one).
                </li>
<li>A new
                    <code>&lt;rewrite&gt;</code>
                    tag has been created that
                    renders a request URI, possibly encoded with a session
                    identifier,
                    based on exactly the same rules used by the
                    <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>
                    tag that generates hyperlinks. These constants can be
                    useful when
                    you are creating JavaScript code that needs to be aware of
                    Struts
                    addressing concepts.
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>options</code>
                    tag now supports a new
                    <code>collection</code>
                    attribute,
                    which can be used to specify a collection whose beans have
                    properties
                    that return the value (to be returned to the server) and
                    the label (to
                    be displayed to the user) from a single collection. The
                    previous
                    support for processing parallel collections is still
                    available.
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>form</code>
                    tag has been enhanced to look up the name of the
                    form bean, it's Java class, and the scope in which the
                    bean should be
                    created or accessed, from the corresponding action mapping
                    entry in the
                    &quot;struts-config.xml&quot; file, if the
                    <code>name</code>
                    ,
                    <code>scope</code>
                    ,
                    and
                    <code>type</code>
                    attributes are not specified. This removes the
                    need to make changes in two places when these values are
                    changed.
                </li>
<li>A new
                    <code>&lt;image&gt;</code>
                    tag has been added, to create
                    HTML input tags of type &quot;image&quot;.
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>form</code>
                    tag has been enhanced to read its configuration from
                    a corresponding action mapping entry in the
                    &quot;struts-config.xml&quot; file,
                    if the
                    <code>name</code>
                    ,
                    <code>scope</code>
                    , and
                    <code>type</code>
                    attributes are not specified. It can look up the name of
                    the
                    form bean, its Java class, the scope in which the bean
                    should be
                    created or accessed, plus the path to which the form
                    should be
                    submitted. This removes the need to make changes in two
                    places when these
                    values are changed. It works for cases where the
                    controller servlet is
                    extension mapped or path mapped.
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>&lt;html:img&gt;</code>
                    tag has been added, to render an HTML
                    <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>
                    tag.
                </li>
</ul>
<p>A new package of Actions and associated classes for handling
                file uploads
                has been created (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.upload</code>
                ):
            </p>
<ul><li>The basic package of file upload handling actions has been
                    created.</li>
<li>An example application illustrating the use of the new
                    features
                    has been added (
                    <code>webapps/struts-upload.war</code>
                    ).
                </li>
</ul>
<p>The following major new features have been added to the utility
                classes
                library (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.util</code>
                ):
            </p>
<ul><li>Initial implementation of a JDBC data source that
                    implements the
                    <code>javax.sql.DataSource</code>
                    interface from the JDBC 2.0 Standard
                    Extensions API. This implementation may be configured
                    based on new
                    extensions to the Struts configuration file DTD, and the
                    configured
                    data sources / connection pools are made available to
                    application
                    components as a servlet context attribute (i.e. an
                    application scope
                    bean).
                </li>
<li>The previous implementation of
                    <code>MessageResources</code>
                    , which was
                    ultimately based on
                    <code>java.util.ResourceBundle</code>
                    , has been
                    completely replaced and re-implemented. The primary
                    features of the
                    new implementation are:
                    <ul><li>All components stored as servlet context
                            attributes now implement
                            the
                            <code>java.io.Serializable</code>
                            interface, to better integrate
                            with application servers that prefer this.
                        </li>
<li>The
                            <code>MessageResources</code>
                            and
                            <code>MessageResourcesFactory</code>
                            classes have been abstracted so that you can
                            easily create your
                            own implementations that derive their message
                            strings from resources
                            other than property files.
                        </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Property gets and sets made through
                    <code>PropertyUtils</code>
                    can now
                    use a new syntax for indexed and nested properties.
                </li>
<li>Conversion to and from numeric types now support a
                    configurable default
                    value to use when conversion fails.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following major new features have been added to the
                <em>Struts Example Application</em>
                :
            </p>
<ul><li>The form beans used in the example application now use
                    request scope
                    rather than session scope. This is the preferred approach
                    for single
                    page forms that contain
                    <em>all</em>
                    of your relevant properties,
                    because there is no need to maintain such form beans
                    across requests.
                    Note that the action classes have been coded so that they
                    work with
                    either request scope or session scope beans.
                </li>
<li>The Struts Example Application has been updated to utilize
                    the new
                    (separated) custom tag libraries, rather than the old
                    combined one,
                    as well as the latest features of the tags being
                    used.</li>
<li>A &quot;Walking Tour of the Struts Example Application&quot; has
                    been added, to
                    highlight features for newcomers to Struts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following major new documentation updates have been added
                to
                Struts:</p>
<ul><li>All documentation is generated from XML input files, using
                    a standard
                    stylesheet to create a common look and feel.</li>
<li>Developer Guides for the Java classes in the
                    <code>org.apache.struts.digester</code>
                    and
                    <code>org.apache.struts.util</code>
                    packages.
                </li>
<li>Developer Guides for the following Struts custom tag
                    libraries have
                    been added:
                    <code>struts-bean</code>
                    ,
                    <code>struts-html</code>

                    .
                </li>
<li>The Struts Users Guide has been brought up to date with
                    respect to
                    all of the changes since Struts 0.5, and separated into
                    multiple
                    HTML pages for easy reading.</li>
<li>Installation information has been updated to include
                    platform-specific
                    notes, issues, and workarounds.</li>
<li>A new resources page now points at external information

                    related to Struts.</li>
<li>A new example application,
                    <code>struts-blank</code>
                    , is included as a
                    quick starting point for new application development.

<div class="section"><h2><a name="Changes_and_Bug_Fixes"></a>Changes and Bug Fixes</h2>
<p>The following changes and bug fixes to the controller servlet
                and
                associated classes (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.action</code>
                ) have
                occurred:
            </p>
<ul><li>The
                    <code>ActionMapping</code>
                    interface has been converted to a base
                    class instead, to reduce the impact of future
                    enhancements. Anyone who
                    has extended the
                    <code>ActionMappingBase</code>
                    convenience base class
                    (which has been deprecated) should extend
                    <code>ActionMapping</code>
                    instead.
                </li>
<li>In conjunction with the new configuration file format
                    mentioned above,
                    the properties of
                    <code>ActionMapping</code>
                    have been substantially
                    updated. See the ActionMapping API Documentation for more
                    information
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>Action</code>
                    interface has been converted to a base class
                    instead, to reduce the impact of future enhancements.
                    Anyone who has
                    extended the
                    <code>ActionBase</code>
                    convenience base class (which
                    has been deprecated) should extend
                    <code>Action</code>
                    instead.
                </li>
<li>In conjunction with the above change, the
                    <code>servlet</code>
                    argument has been removed from the parameter list for the
                    <code>perform()</code>
                    method, because it is now redundant -- the
                    associated servlet is set via the
                    <code>setServlet()</code>
                    method
                    when the
                    <code>Action</code>
                    instance is first created.
                </li>
<li>Responsibility for creating
                    <code>Action</code>
                    instances has been moved
                    from
                    <code>ActionMapping</code>
                    to the controller servlet, so that
                    instance lifecycle management can be performed. As a side
                    effect of this
                    change, if you had two actions that used the same Action
                    class name,
                    there will now be only one (shared) instance of the Action
                    class,
                    rather than two.
                </li>
<li>New
                    <code>log(String, int)</code>
                    method that logs the associated message
                    only if you have configured the debugging detail level for
                    the servlet to
                    an equal or higher value.
                </li>
<li>In
                    <code>ActionServlet</code>
                    , the functionality to populate form bean
                    parameters from a request, and the functionality to
                    validate the form
                    bean's contents, has been separated into two methods that
                    can be
                    overridden individually if required.
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>ActionServlet</code>
                    functionality to call the
                    <code>validate()</code>
                    method of a form bean is skipped if the user
                    pressed the Cancel key (i.e. the submit button created by
                    the
                    <code>&lt;html:cancel&gt;</code>
                    custom tag), or if the selected
                    mapping does not define an input form to return control
                    to.
                </li>
<li>The controller servlet may now be used as the target of a
                    <code>RequestDispatcher.include()</code>
                    or
                    <code>&lt;jsp:include/&gt;</code>
                    call. Previously, it would mistakenly
                    use the original request URI, rather than the included
                    path, to calculate
                    which action class to execute.
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>ActionMappings.getUnknown()</code>
                    method now takes the current
                    request as an parameter, so that context-sensitive
                    decisions can be
                    made.
                </li>
<li>When the controller servlet processes an
                    <code>ActionForward</code>
                    that
                    has the
                    <code>redirect</code>
                    property set, it now performs URL rewriting
                    to maintain session state even if cookies are not being
                    used.
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>ActionErrors</code>
                    class now includes a method that will
                    return an Iterator over the error messages related to a
                    particular
                    input field.
                </li>
</ul>
<p>The following changes and bug fixes to the Digester module
                (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.digester</code>
                ) have occurred:
            </p>
<ul><li>The
                    <code>Digester.resolveEntity()</code>
                    method has been enhanced
                    to correctly handle local URIs so that it works with
                    resources loaded via
                    <code>Class.getResource()</code>
                    .
                </li>
<li>The input source handed to the Digester is now closed,
                    even if a
                    parsing exception is throw.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following changes and bug fixes to the
                <em>struts-bean</em>
                custom
                tag library (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.bean</code>
                ) have
                occurred:
            </p>
<ul><li>By default, the
                    <code>&lt;bean:write&gt;</code>
                    tag will filter output
                    for characters sensitive to HTML. You can turn this off by
                    adding a
                    <code>filter=&quot;false&quot;</code>
                    attribute.
                </li>
<li>When performing a
                    <code>&lt;bean:include&gt;</code>
                    in a page that is
                    part of a session, pass the session identifier along on
                    the generated
                    request so that it will be part of the same session.
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>&lt;bean:define&gt;</code>
                    tag can now create
                    beans directly from the
                    <code>value</code>
                    attribute, if desired.
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>&lt;bean:define&gt;</code>
                    tag now accepts an optional
                    <code>toScope</code>
                    attribute, to declare which scope the new bean
                    should be created in. The default remains
                    <code>page</code>
                    scope.
                </li>
<li>Default values can now be specified on
                    <code>&lt;bean:cookie&gt;</code>
                    ,
                    <code>&lt;bean:header&gt;</code>
                    , and
                    <code>&lt;bean:parameter&gt;</code>
                    tags, which are used when the
                    corresponding value is not present in the current request.
                </li>
</ul>
<p>The following changes and bug fixes to the
                <em>struts-html</em>
                custom
                tag library (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.html</code>
                ) have
                occurred:
            </p>
<ul><li><strong>WARNING</strong>
                    - When the Struts 0.5 tag library was originally
                    split into separate libraries, this library was named
                    <em>struts-form</em>
                    , to reflect the fact that the majority of tags
                    related to creating input forms. It has been renamed to
                    <em>struts-html</em>
                    to reflect the fact that all of the tags in this
                    library are relevant only when building HTML-based user
                    interfaces.
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>&lt;html:html&gt;</code>
                    tag now supports a
                    <code>locale=&quot;true&quot;</code>
                    attribute that requests the same Locale
                    negotiation (based on the presence of an
                    <code>Accept-Language</code>
                    header) that is performed by the controller servlet.
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>&lt;html:link&gt;</code>
                    tag now supports the ability to add
                    a single request parameter (based on a bean property) in
                    addition to the
                    ability to add request parameters from a Map.
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>&lt;html:errors&gt;</code>
                    tag lets you select only the error
                    messages related to a particular input field, or all
                    errors.
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>&lt;html:password&gt;</code>
                    tag now optionally redisplays
                    the previous value of the input field.
                </li>
<li>The value returned by a
                    <code>&lt;html:multibox&gt;</code>
                    tag can now
                    be specified in the body of the tag, as well as via the
                    <code>value</code>
                    attribute.
                </li>
</ul>
<p>The following changes and bug fixes to the
                <em>struts-logic</em>
                custom tag library (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.logic</code>
                )
                have occurred:
            </p>
<ul><li>The
                    <code>&lt;logic:present&gt;</code>
                    and
                    <code>&lt;logic:notPresent&gt;</code>
                    tags now accept a
                    <code>role</code>
                    attribute that allows you to detect whether the currently
                    authenticated
                    user does, or does not, possess a particular security
                    role.
                </li>
</ul>
<p>The following changes and bug fixes to the
                <em>struts-template</em>
                custom tag library (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.template</code>
                )
                have occurred:
            </p>
<ul><li>The
                    <code>&lt;template:put&gt;</code>
                    tag now accepts a
                    <code>direct</code>
                    attribute that causes the content being put to be
                    rendered directly, rather than being included.
                </li>
</ul>
<p>The following changes and bug fixes to the Utilities package
                (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.util</code>
                ) have occurred:
            </p>
<ul><li>Fixed
                    <code>PropertyUtils.getPropertyType()</code>
                    to correctly return
                    the underlying element type even if there was a
                    non-indexed property
                    getter method.
                </li>
<li>Added a missing &quot;return&quot; statement to
                    <code>PropertyUtils.setIndexedProperty()</code>
                    .
                </li>
<li>Functionality in
                    <code>BeanUtils</code>
                    that previously duplicated
                    functionality that was earlier moved to
                    <code>PropertyUtils</code>
                    has been removed.
                </li>
<li>Fixed
                    <code>PropertyUtils.copyProperties()</code>
                    to skip cases where
                    the origin bean has a getter method but the destination
                    bean does not
                    have a setter method.
                </li>
<li>Added
                    <code>BeanUtils.cloneBean()</code>
                    to create a new instance of
                    an existing bean, and copy all known properties, even if
                    the bean class
                    does not implement
                    <code>Cloneable</code>
                    .
                </li>
<li>The
                    <code>BeanUtils</code>
                    class has been refactored so that it, and
                    the associated
                    <code>ConvertUtils</code>
                    and
                    <code>PropertyUtils</code>
                    classes, can easily be used without having to have the
                    servlet API
                    classes available on the classpath.
                </li>
<li>Property introspection is now smarter, so that you can
                    access public
                    methods declared in an implemented interface, even if the
                    class itself
                    is not public.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following changes and bug fixes to the Struts Example
                Application
                (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.example</code>
                and the corresponding web
                components) have occurred:
            </p>
<ul><li>Used the
                    <code>reset()</code>
                    methods defined by the
                    <code>ActionForm</code>
                    interface to reset form bean properties to
                    default values. This is particularly important to make
                    boolean
                    properties (represented visually by checkboxes) work
                    correctly.
                </li>
<li>Eliminate the special-case handling of null String values
                    in the
                    form beans. Such handling is not necessary because the
                    custom tags
                    correctly deal with null String values.</li>
<li>Use the
                    <code>PropertyUtils.copyProperties()</code>
                    method to initially
                    populate form beans from underlying data objects, and to
                    update date
                    objects when a transaction is successfully completed. Note
                    that using
                    this approach dramatically lessens an action class's
                    dependence on the
                    specific properties of the form bean and corresponding
                    data object
                    in many use cases.
                </li>
<li>Added an
                    <code>autoConnect</code>
                    boolean property to the Subscription
                    data object, primarily to illustrate that representing a
                    boolean
                    property with a checkbox now works correctly if you set
                    the property
                    to
                    <code>false</code>
                    in the
                    <code>reset()</code>
                    method of your
                    form beans.
