                <p>Java technologies give developers a serious boost when
                    creating and maintaining applications to meet the demands
                    of today's public Web sites and enterprise intranets.
                    Struts combines standard Java
                    technologies into a unified framework.

<dd>
                <p>Java Servlets are designed to handle requests made by Web
                    browsers. Server pages are designed to create dynamic web
                    pages that can turn billboard sites into interactive 
                    applications. Struts uses a special
                    Servlet as a switchboard to route requests from Web
                    browsers to the appropriate server page. 
                    Along the way, a special Java class, called an Action, 
                    can interact with a data access framework or business 
                    logic classes.
                    A layered architecture makes enterprise-grade web
                    applications easier to create and maintain.

                <p>Yes. The Apache Struts Project is committed to supporting 
                    industry standards.
                    Struts acts as an integrator of Java technologies so that
                    they can be used in the &quot;real world&quot;.</p>

                <p>There are several
                    <a href="http://struts.apache.org/volunteers.html">active committers</a>
                    to the Apache Struts project, working cooperatively from
                    around the globe. Dozens of individual developers and
                    committers contributed to the Struts 1.x codebase. All
                    interested developers and wordsmiths are invited to
                    <a href="http://struts.apache.org/helping.html#contribute">
                        contribute to the project</a>
                    .
               </p>
                <p>The initial Struts codebase (Struts 0.5) was created by
                    Craig R. McClanahan in May 2000 and donated to The Apache
                    Software Foundation in May 2000. Craig was the primary
                    developer of both Struts 1.x and
                    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html">
                        Tomcat 4</a>
                    . Tomcat 4 was the basis for the official reference
                    implementation for a servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 container.
               </p>
                <p>After serving as the co-lead of the JSR 127 specification
                    (JavaServerFaces), Craig created another rendition of
                    Struts
                    based on JavaServer Faces, called Shale. The new framework 
                    began as an Apache Struts subproject, but later Shale 
                    graduated to a  top-level Apache project
                    in its own right. 
                    <a href="http://shale.apache.org/">
                      Apache Shale</a> is an excellent choice for teams 
                    creating complex applications that utilize JSF
                    as a foundation technology.

<dd>
                <p>No, not by a long shot. When Struts 1.0 shipped in June
                    2001, there were already several other web application
                    frameworks available, including Barracuda, Expresso,
                    Maverick, Tapestry, and Turbine, to name a few. Struts did
                    not enter a "greenfield". Back in the day, there were
                    lively comparisons between the available frameworks,
                    just as there are today. 
              </p>
            <table border="0"><tr><td align="right"><a href="#top">[top]</a></td></tr></table><hr />
</dd>
<dt><a name="popular">Is Struts the most popular web application
                framework for Java?</a></dt>
<dd>
                <p>Yes. By any objective measure, Struts continues to
                    be the most popular web application framework for
                    Java.</p>
                <p>As of 2006, the vast majority of job offerings for Java
                    developers cite Struts as prerequisite. According to
                    OnJava magazine between their reader surveys for 2005 and
                    2004 the popularity of Struts remained steady. Likewise,
                    the number of Struts articles published in all online
                    journals also remained constant between 2004 and 2005. 
                    (For a complete list, see the 
                    <a href="http://www.StrutsCentral.net/">
                    Struts Central website</a>.)                    
                    New and updated books about Struts continue to be 
                    published regularly.</p>
                <p>While some people characterize the space of Java web
                    application framework as being "fragmented", the truth is
                    that
                    <b>more web developers use Struts than all other
                        alternatives combined.</b>
                    This observation is as true in 2006 as it was in 2005,
                    as it was in 2004. It's probably been true since Struts
                    released its 1.0 version in 2001.
               </p>
                <p>Of course, some developers are finding that JavaServer
                    Faces can be a faster way to write new applications,
                    especially modest intranet applications. And
                    that's great! More than anything else, every Struts
                    committer wants every developer to get more out of every
                    work day. (We're developers too!) As these new JSF
                    applications grow in complexity, we're glad that 
                    <a href="http://shale.apache.org/">
                      Apache Shale</a> is ready to do for
                    <em>JSF</em>
                    developers what Struts has
                    been doing for
                    <em>JSP</em>
                    developers, year after year
                    after year.
               </p>
                <p>Meanwhile, enterprise web developers who have standardized
                    on Struts can be assured that new releases of
                    Struts 1 will continue, even as we break new ground with
                    Struts 2.</p>

                <p>To develop applications with Struts, you can usually just
                    add the Struts JAR file
                    to your Java development environment. You can then start
                    using the Struts classes as
                    part of your own application. A blank Struts application
                    (in the
                    <code>webapps</code>
                    directory, open
                    <code>struts-blank.war</code>
                    )
                    is provided, which you can just copy to get a quick-start
                    on your own brainchild.
               </p>
                <p>Aside from the Struts jar, the blank
                    application includes the other Struts
                    Library JARs and dependencies.

               </p>
                <p>Since the full source code for Struts is available, we also
                    provide
                    <a href="http://struts.apache.org/downloads.html#Building">
                        instructions</a>
                    for compiling your own Struts JAR from scratch. 
                    (With Maven, building Struts is easy!)
               </p>
                <p>Your Struts application can usually be deployed using a
                    standard WAR file. In most
                    cases, you simply deposit the WAR file on your application
                    server, and it is installed
                    automatically. If not, step-by-step installation

                        various servlet
                        containers</a>

                classpath?</a></dt>
<dd>
                <p>When you are compiling an application that uses the Struts
                    classes, you must have the Struts JARs on the classpath your
                    <strong>compiler</strong>
                    sees -- it does not
                    <em>have</em>
                    to be on your CLASSPATH environment variable.
               </p>
                <p>Why is that an important distinction? Because if you are
                    using a servlet container on your development machine to
                    test your application, the Struts JARs 
                    <strong>must not</strong>
                    be on your CLASSPATH environment variable when running the
                    container. (This is because each Web application must also
                    have their own copy of the Struts classes, and the
                    container will become confused if it is on the environment
                    path as well.)
               </p>
                <p>There are several general approaches to this issue:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Use Ant or Maven</strong>
                        for building your projects -- it can easily assemble
                        classpaths for the compiler. 
                   </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Use an IDE</strong>
                        where you can configure the "class path" used for
                        compilation independent of the CLASSPATH environment
                        variable.
                   </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Use a shell script</strong>
                        that temporarily adds struts-action.jar to the
                        classpath just for compilation, for example
                        <br></br>
                        <em>javac -classpath
                            /path/to/struts-action.jar:$CLASSPATH $@</em>
                   </li>
               </ul>

<dd>
                <p>
                    Struts currently has two testing
                    environments, to reflect the fact that
                    some things can be tested statically, and some really need
                    to be done in
                    the environment of a running servlet container.</p>
                <p>
                    For static unit tests, we use the
                    <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit framework</a>
                    .
                    The sources for these tests are in the "src/test"
                    hierarchy in the source repository, and are executed via
                    the "test.junit"
                    target in the top-level build.xml file. Such tests are
                    focused on the
                    low-level functionality of individual methods, are
                    particularly
                    suitable for the static methods in the
                    org.apache.struts.util utility
                    classes. In the test hierarchy, there are also some "mock
                    object" classes
                    (in the org.apache.struts.mock package) so that you can
                    package up things
                    that look like servlet API and Struts API objects to pass
                    in as arguments
                    to such tests.
               </p>

                    Another valuable tool is
                    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/strutstestcase/">
                        Struts TestCase</a>
                    which provides a useful harness for Action classes that
                    can be used with JUnit or
