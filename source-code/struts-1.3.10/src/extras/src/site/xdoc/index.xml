            <a name="welcome"/>

            <p>
                Struts Extras provides several popular but non-essential 
                classes, including:
            </p>
            <table>
            <tr><th>ActionDispatcher</th><td>An Action helper class that dispatches to a public method in an Action.
            </td></tr>
            <tr>
            <th>BaseAction</th><td>BaseAction is provided as an intermediate class for shared funtionality between Action and any stock implementation provided in this package.
            </td></tr>
            <tr>
            <th>DigestingPlugIn</th><td>An implementation of PlugIn which can be configured to instantiate a graph of objects using the Commons Digester and place the root object of that graph into the Application context.
            </td></tr>
            <tr>
            <th>DispatchAction</th><td>This Action is useful for developers who prefer to combine many similar actions into a single Action class, in order to simplify their application design.
            </td></tr>
            <tr>
            <th>DownloadAction</th><td>This is an abstract base class that minimizes the amount of special coding that needs to be written to download a file. 
            </td></tr>
            <tr>
            <th>DynaValidatorActionForm</th><td>This class differs from the core DynaValidatorForm in that the key passed into the validator is the action element's 'path' attribute from the struts-config.xml which should match the form element's name attribute in the validation.xml.
            </td></tr>
            <tr>
            <th>EventActionDispatcher</th><td>An Action helper class that dispatches to to one of the public methods that are named in the parameter attribute of the corresponding ActionMapping and matches a submission parameter.
            </td></tr>
            <tr>
            <th> EventDispatchAction</th><td>An Action that dispatches to to one of the public methods that are named in the parameter attribute of the corresponding ActionMapping and matches a submission parameter
            </td></tr>
            <tr>
            <th>ForwardAction</th><td>An Action that forwards to the context-relative URI specified by the parameter property of our associated ActionMapping.
            </td></tr>
            <tr>
            <th>IncludeAction</th><td>An Action that includes the context-relative URI specified by the parameter property of our associated ActionMapping. 
            </td></tr>
            <tr>
            <th>LocaleAction</th><td>Implementation of Action that changes the user's Locale and forwards to a page, based on request level parameters that are set (language, country, and page).
            </td></tr>
            <tr>
            <th>LookupDispatchAction</th><td> An abstract Action that dispatches to the subclass mapped execute method. This is useful in cases where an HTML form has multiple submit buttons with the same name
            </td></tr>
            <tr>
            <th>MappingDispatchAction</th><td>An abstract Action that dispatches to a public method that is named by the parameter attribute of the corresponding ActionMapping.
            </td></tr>
            <tr>
            <th>ModuleConfigVerifier</th><td>Convenient implementation of PlugIn that performs as many verification tests on the information stored in the ModuleConfig  for this module as is practical.
            </td></tr>
            <tr>
            <th>SwitchAction</th><td>A standard Action that switches to a new module and then forwards control to a URI (specified in a number of possible ways) within the new module.
            </td></tr>
            <tr>
            <th>ValidatorActionForm</th><td> This class differs from the core ValidatorForm in that the key passed into the validator is the action element's 'path' attribute from the struts-config.xml which should match the form element's name attribute in the validation.xml.
            </td></tr>
            <tr>
            <th></th><td>
            </td></tr>
            </table>
            
            <p>
            Many of the "extra" classes are simple, and the easiest way to learn how to use 
            one of them, can be to review the 
            <a href="apidocs/index.html">Javadocs</a> 
            and 
            <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/struts/struts1/trunk/extras/src/main/java/org/apache/struts/">
            source code.</a>
            </p>

                        <blockquote>            
            <p>
            Note that there is not an "extras" package, per se.
            Each of the "extra" classes uses a relevant package from the core distribution, 
            such as Action, Plugins, or Validator.
            </p>
                        </blockquote>            
                        
            <p>
            In some cases, you may like to use these classes as a starting point 
            for your own custom versions. 
            In that case, feel free to adopt and adapt the source, 
            following the provisions of the 
            <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/">Apache License.</a>
