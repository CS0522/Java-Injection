                    documentation team.
                    Any Struts user (that means you!) is invited to post new
                    material to
                    the Wiki.
                    However, the Wiki is not the place to ask incidental
                    questions.
                    <strong>All support questions should be directed to the

                    The framework has attracted a large and robust community
                    of developers,
                    which have created a vast number of Struts related
                    resources.
                    Several pages on our wiki are devoted to listing
