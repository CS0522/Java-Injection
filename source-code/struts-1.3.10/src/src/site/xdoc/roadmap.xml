                    The Apache Struts Projects uses the
                    <a href="http://issues.apache.org/struts/">
                        JIRA issuer tracker</a>
                    to manage problem reports
                    and enhancement suggestions.
                    For your convenience, here are some common JIRA 
                    queries:

                <p>
                    Releases in the 1.x series will focus on refactoring of
                    existing functionality, with a continued emphasis on
                    backward compatibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    New features are being added to the 1.x series,
                    but only if backward compatability with the prior release
                    can be retained.
                    The framework's API is evolving through a strict
                    deprecate/replace/remove protocol.
                    Developers are encouraged to stay current with the "best
                    available"
                    release and to observe deprecation warnings.
                    Features are deprecated before removal, and deprecated
                    features are
                    removed in a subsequent release.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Throughout the 1.x series,
                    there will be a continued emphasis on expanding unit test
                    coverage.
                    Bug reports should include a failing test case when
                    possible.
                    Proposals for new features should include a working test
                    suite.
                    (Creating features through Test Driven Development is
                    encouraged.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Enhancement requests are logged in JIRA as they are
                    suggested.
                    <strong>The listing of an enhancement in JIRA does not
                        imply that
                        it is being "planned",</strong>
                    merely that someone has suggested it,
                    and the idea hasn't been ruled out (yet).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Future release
                    <a href="#milestones">milestones</a>
                    are provided
                    for enhancements which are being actively planned or
                    developed
                    but may not be ready for the current release.
                    If a report has not been tagged for a specific milestone
                    by a working developer,
                    then
                    <strong>it may never be implemented</strong>
                    .
                    When developers (including non-Committers) are actually
                    working on an
                    enhancement,
                    they should re-tag it for a specific release milestone,
                    such as "1.4.1" or "1.4.2".
                </p>

                <p>
                    If an enhancement has not been tagged for a specific
                    target,
                    feel free to start working on it yourself.
                    Many of our best features have been contributed by
                    developers,
                    just like you.
                    If you are working on an enhancement,
                    post a note on the ticket that you are working on an
                    enhancement
                    and then post a patch as soon as possible.
                    If the development effort doesn't succeed,
                    post a note to the ticket explaining what problem you had
                    creating the enhancement,
                    so that other developers can explore alternatives.
                </p>

                    These are milestones of where we have been, where we are, and 
                    possibly where we are going.
