            <p>
                <strong>DEPRECATIONS</strong>
                - The entire custom tag library
                that is documented in
                <code>struts.tld</code>
                has been deprecated.
                These tags correspond to the Struts 0.5 functionality that is
                also
                deprecated, and have been replaced (and considerably enhanced)
                in
                the various individual tag libraries.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>DEPRECATIONS</strong>
                - The entire custom tag library
                that is documented in
                <code>struts-form.tld</code>
                has been deprecated
                because this library has been renamed
                <code>struts-html.tld</code>
                instead.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>DEPRECATIONS</strong>
                - Several classes in the
                <code>org.apache.struts.util</code>
                package have been marked as
                deprecated in their entirety, because they will be replaced by
                versions from the Jakarta Commons project once those packages
                are
                released. These deprecated classes will
                <strong>not</strong>
                be
                removed until a release after Struts 1.1. In general, the only
                change required inside user code using these classes will be
                to
                update the
                <code>import</code>
                statement. The following classes
                are involved:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>ArrayStack</li>
                <li>BeanUtils</li>
                <li>ConvertUtils</li>
                <li>FastArrayList</li>
                <li>FastHashMap</li>
                <li>FastTreeMap</li>
                <li>GenericConnection</li>
                <li>GenericDataSource</li>
                <li>PropertyUtils</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The following new features have been added to the basic
                controller
                framework (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.action</code>
                ):
            </p>

            <p>The following new features have been added to the utility
                classes
                (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.util</code>
                ):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>GenericDataSource</code>
                    can now be configured with a "ping"
                    type command (via the
                    <code>pingCommand</code>
                    and
                    <code>pingQuery</code>
                    properties) that will be executed before
                    returning a connection from
                    <code>getConnection()</code>
                    . This
                    can be used to detect stale connections due to timeouts or
                    a
                    database server restart. If the ping command fails, the
                    corresponding
                    connection will be thrown away, and a new one allocated.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <p>The following new features have been added to the
                <em>struts-html</em>
                custom tag library (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.html</code>
                ):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is now possible to use any object in the values and
                    labels
                    collections for the
                    <code>&lt;html:options&gt;</code>
                    tag.
                </li>
                <li>Added the missing
                    <code>tabindex</code>
                    attribute to the
                    <code>&lt;html:radio&gt;</code>
                    tag.
                </li>
                <li>On the
                    <code>&lt;html:img&gt;</code>
                    ,
                    <code>&lt;html:link&gt;</code>
                    ,
                    and
                    <code>&lt;html:rewrite&gt;</code>
                    tags, you can now specify
                    arbitrary object values in the
                    <code>Map</code>
                    used to include
                    dynamic request attributes, as long as the
                    <code>toString()</code>
                    method renders the values appropriately.
                </li>
                <li>In all cases where "minimized" attributes were being
                    generated
                    (

                files related to Struts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The DTD for
                    <code>struts-config.xml</code>
                    files had an incorrect
                    ENTITY declaration for the
                    <code>Location</code>
                    element.
                </li>
                <li>The DTD for version 2.3 web application deployment
                    descriptors has
                    been updated to the most recent (Proposed Final Draft 2)
                    version.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The following changes and bug fixes have occurred in the basic
                controller framework (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.action</code>
                ):
            </p>


            <p>The following changes and bug fixes have occurred in the
                utilities
                (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.util</code>
                ):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The
                    <code>FastArrayMap()</code>
                    ,
                    <code>FastHashMap()</code>
                    , and
                    <code>FastTreeMap()</code>
                    classes not correctly implement the
                    <code>clone()</code>
                    ,
                    <code>equals()</code>
                    , and
                    <code>hashCode()</code>
                    methods consistent with the requirements
                    of the Java standard Collections APIs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>PropertyUtils</code>
                    can now access public methods defined
                    in nested interfaces.
                </li>
                <li>A misleading error message returned by
                    <code>BeanUtils</code>
                    has been corrected.
                </li>
                <li>Work around a problem compiling the
                    <code>FastXxxxx</code>
                    classes
                    with the VAJ compiler, because the superclass already
                    includes a
                    private class named
                    <code>Iterator</code>
                    .
                </li>
                <li>Remove a JDK 1.3 dependency that prevented compiling
                    <code>BeanUtils</code>
                    under JDK 1.2.
                </li>
                <li>Generate "&amp;amp;" instead of "&amp;" in query strings
                    that
                    contain more than one name/value pair.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The following changes and bug fixes have occurred in the
                <em>struts-html</em>
                custom tag library (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.html</code>
                ):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Restore the ability of the
                    <code>&lt;html:button&gt;</code>
                    tag to
                    retrieve the button text from the nested body content (so
                    that it
                    can be easily internationalized).
                </li>
                <li>If the property name used in the
                    <code>labelProperty</code>
                    attribute of an
                    <code>&lt;html:options&gt;</code>
                    tag is invalid,
                    report the correct property name in the error message.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The following changes and bug fixes have occurred in the
                <em>struts-logic</em>
                custom tag library (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.logic</code>
                ):
            </p>


            <p>The following changes and bug fixes to the Struts Documentation
                application (and corresponding contents on the Struts web
                site) have
                occurred:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fix a reference to an old Struts 0.5 tag in one of the
                    User's Guide
                    examples.</li>
                <li>Fix the stylesheet used to transform XML into HTML
                    documentation so
                    that nested
                    <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
                    tags are not created.
                </li>
                <li>The DTD for Struts configuration files has been refined to
                    highlight
                    the fact that you should use
                    <code>&lt;set-property&gt;</code>
                    elements to configure your data source implementation.
