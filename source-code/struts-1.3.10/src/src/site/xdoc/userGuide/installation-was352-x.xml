                    Example Application</h4>

                <p>Server: Windows 2000 Server with WebSphere 3.5.3
                    Advanced</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start up the adminserver.</li>
                    <li>Start up Admin Console.</li>
                    <li>Use the Convert War file task to convert the
                        struts-example.war from the
                        struts-b1 distrib as-is.</li>
                    <li>Convert to the default_server, default servlet engine
                        and standard
                        install directory
                        (c:\websphere\appserver\hosts\default_host).</li>
                    <li>Create a WEB-INF directory in the servlets dir and
                        copy
                        struts-config.xml, database.xml AND web.xml into it
                        (Keep WEB-INF with all
                        the TLD's under web - both WEB-INF directories must be
                        present).</li>
                    <li>Copy jaxp 1.0.1's (NOT 1.1.1's) jaxp.jar and
                        parser.jar to the servlets
                        directory of the strut-example webapp.</li>
                    <li>In the servlets directory, open struts.jar with
                        WinZip. Extract the
                        three DTD's (struts-config_1_0.dtd, web-app_2_2.dtd
                        and web-app_2_3.dtd)
                        into the servlets directory making sure you use folder
                        names (so the files
                        extract to servlets/org/apache/struts/resources).</li>
                    <li>Click on struts-example in the Admin Console under
                        Default Server/Default
                        Servlet Engine and click the advanced tab on the right
                        hand side of the
                        screen.</li>
                    <li>Down where it says Default Error Page, enter
                        /ErrorReporter and then
                        click Apply.</li>
                    <li>Start the Default Server via the Admin Console. You
                        should see a whole
                        bunch of ActionServlet messages in the
                        default_host_stdout.log file with no
                        exceptions.</li>
                    <li>Via a browser accessed the app using
                        http://localhost/struts-example/index.jsp.</li>
                    <li>If it returns "Application not Available" then go back
                        to the Admin
                        Console, right-click on struts-example and select
                        Restart WebApp.</li>
                    <li>Once it reports success, go back to the URL above and
                        try again - it
                        should work flawlessly.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    For whatever reason, some installations do not like XML
                    files that reference
                    PUBLIC DTD's - if in looking at the
                    default_host_stdout.log file you see
                    errors about invalid public URL references during DTD
                    registrations, or if
                    your pages say "cannot find //logon or //saveRegistration
                    (ie. action
                    mappings) then do the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Stop Default Server</li>
                    <li>Go to servlets\WEB-INF\ and edit web.xml and
                        struts_config.xml.</li>
                    <li>In the DOCTYPE declaration, change the word PUBLIC to
                        SYSTEM and
                        completely remove the line that reads "-//Sun
                        Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web
                        Application 2.2//EN" from web.xml and remove
                        "-//Apache Software
                        Foundation//DTD Struts Configuration 1.0//EN" from
                        struts-config.xml.</li>
                    <li>Save these changes and go back to step 10 above.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Just as a troubleshooting guide -</p>
                <p>If you are getting errors like "Cannot find ActionMappings,
                    etc..." or
                    "Cannot find key org.apache.struts.MESSAGE" then your
                    application is most
                    likely still bombing on the struts-config issue that
                    Richard discovered.
                    The above steps SHOULD correct that leaving nothing out.
                    If you are getting
                    404 errors about //logon or something not found, then you
                    are still having
                    XML config troubles and it is not initializing the Action
                    servlet properly.
                    Follow the steps above in regards to DTD's and it should
                    work.</p>
                <p>As a final thought, I obviously haven't gotten to test too
                    much but I don't
                    believe that there are ANY coding changes that need to be
                    made to the actual
                    struts source. Everything about getting it to work in
                    WebSphere has been a
                    WebSphere configuration issue thus far (and I don't think
                    I'll be having any
                    more).</p>
                <p>If changing the DTD's to SYSTEM, do so ONLY AFTER using the
                    Convert a War
                    util. Ant doesn't seem to like it the other way! :)</p>
