                    The framework provides infrastructural support for view
                    components,
                    but does not provide any actual view components of its
                    own.
                    Several <a href="#presentation_frameworks">

                <p>
                    A few years ago, application developers could count on
                    having to support
                    only residents of their own country, who are used to only
                    one (or
                    sometimes two) languages, and one way to represent numeric
                    quantities like
                    dates, numbers, and monetary values.
                    However, the explosion of application development based on
                    web
                    technologies, as well as the deployment of such
                    applications on the
                    Internet and other broadly accessible networks, have
                    rendered national
                    boundaries invisible in many cases.
                    This has translated (if you will pardon the pun) into a
                    need for
                    applications to support
                    <em>internationalization</em>
                    (often called "i18n"
                    because 18 is the number of letters in between the "i" and
                    the "n") and
                    <em>localization.</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The framework builds upon the standard classes available on the
                    Java platform to
                    build internationalized and localized applications.
                    The key concepts to become familiar with are:

                        </a>
                        - The fundamental Java class that supports
                        internationalization is
                        <code>Locale</code>
                        .
                        Each
                        <code>Locale</code>
                        represents a particular choice of country and
                        language (plus an optional language variant), and also
                        a set of
                        formatting assumptions for things like numbers and
                        dates.

                        </a>
                        - The
                        <code>java.util.ResourceBundle</code>
                        class provides the fundamental tools for supporting
                        messages in
                        multiple languages.
                        See the Javadocs for the
                        <code>ResourceBundle</code>
                        class, and the
                        information on Internationalization in the
                        documentation bundle for your
                        JDK release, for more information.

                            <strong>PropertyResourceBundle</strong>
                        </a>
                        - One of the standard
                        implementations of
                        <code>ResourceBundle</code>
                        allows you to define
                        resources using the same "name=value" syntax used to
                        initialize
                        properties files.
                        This is very convenient for preparing resource bundles
                        with messages
                        that are used in a web application, because these
                        messages are
                        generally text oriented.

                        </a>
                        - The
                        <code>java.text.MessageFormat</code>
                        class allows you to replace portions of a message
                        string (in this
                        case, one retrieved from a resource bundle) with
                        arguments specified
                        at run time.
                        This is useful in cases where you are creating a
                        sentence, but the
                        words would appear in a different order in different
                        languages.
                        The placeholder string
                        <code>{0}</code>
                        in the message is replaced by
                        the first runtime argument,
                        <code>{1}</code>
                        is replaced by the
                        second argument, and so on.

                        lets you treat
                        a set of resource bundles like a database, and allows
                        you to request
                        a particular message string for a particular Locale
                        (normally one
                        associated with the current user) instead of for the
                        default Locale
                        the server itself is running in.

                    Please note that the i18n support in a server-side
                    framework is limited to
                    the
                    <strong>presentation</strong>
                    of internationalized text and images to the user.
                    Support for Locale specific
                    <strong>input methods</strong>
                    (used with languages
                    such as Japanese, Chinese, and Korean) is left up to the
                    client device,
                    which is usually a web browser.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For an internationalized application, follow the steps
                    described in
                    the Internationalization document in the JDK documentation
                    bundle for your
                    platform to create a properties file containing the
                    messages for each
                    language.
                    An example will illustrate this further:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Assume that your source code is created in package
                    <code>com.mycompany.mypackage</code>
                    , so it is stored in a directory
                    (relative to your source directory) named
                    <code>com/mycompany/mypackage.</code>
                    To create a resource bundle called
                    <code>com.mycompany.mypackage.MyApplication,</code>
                    you would create the
                    following files in the
                    <code>com/mycompany/mypackage</code>
                    directory:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        <strong>MyApplication.properties</strong>
                        - Contains the messages in the default
                        language for your server.
                        If your default language is English, you might have an
                        entry like
                        this:
                        <code>prompt.hello=Hello</code>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>MyApplication_xx.properties</strong>
                        - Contains the same messages in the
                        language whose ISO language code is "xx" (See the
                        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html">
                            ResourceBundle Javadoc</a>
                        page for a link to the current list).
                        For a French version of the message shown above, you
                        would have this
                        entry:
                        <code>prompt.hello=Bonjour</code>
                        You can have resource bundle files for as many
                        languages as you need.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    When you configure the controller servlet via the
                    struts-config.xml
                    configuration file, one of the things you will need to
                    define is
                    the base name of the resource bundle for the application.
                    In the case described above, it would be
                    <code>com.mycompany.mypackage.MyApplication.</code>
                </p>

                <source><![CDATA[
<message-resources parameter="com.mycompany.mypackage.MyApplication"/>
]]></source>

                <p>
                    The important thing is for the resource bundle to be found
                    on the
                    class path for your application.
                    Another approach is to store the
                    <code>MyResources.properties</code>
                    file in your application's
                    <code>classes</code>
                    folder.
                    You can then simply specify "myResources" as the
                    application value.
                    Just be careful it is not deleted if your build script
                    deletes
                    classes as part of a "clean" target.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If it does, here is an Ant task to run when compiling your
                    application
                    that copies the contents of a
                    <code>src/conf</code>
                    directory to the
                    <code>classes</code>
                    directory:
                </p>

                    While the examples given here use JSP and custom tags,

                    The framework can also be used with Cocoon, Velocity Templates,
                    XSLT, and
                    any other presentation technology that can be rendered via

                    At one time or another, most web developers have built

                    Users have come to expect interactive applications to have
                    certain
                    behaviors, and one of these expectations relates to error
                    handling -- if
                    the user makes an error, the application should allow them
                    to fix just
                    what needs to be changed -- without having to re-enter any
                    of the rest
                    of the information on the current page or form.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fulfilling this expectation is tedious and cumbersome when
                    coding with
                    standard HTML and JSP pages.
                    For example, an input element for a
                    <code>username</code>
                    field might
                    look like this (in JSP):
                </p>

                <source><![CDATA[
<input type="text" name="username"
value="<%= loginBean.getUsername() >"/>
]]></source>

                <p>
                    which is difficult to type correctly, confuses HTML
                    developers who are
                    not knowledgeable about programming concepts, and can
                    cause problems with
                    HTML editors.
                    Instead, Struts Taglibs provides a comprehensive facility
                    for
                    building forms,
                    based on the Custom Tag Library facility of JSP 1.1.
                    The case above would be rendered like this using Struts
                    Taglibs:
                </p>

                <source><![CDATA[
<html:text property="username"/>;
]]></source>

                <p>
                    with no need to explicitly refer to the JavaBean from
                    which the initial
                    value is retrieved. That is handled automatically by the
                    JSP tag, using
                    facilities provided by the framework.
                </p>

                <p>
                    HTML forms are sometimes used to upload other files.
                    Most browsers support this through a &lt;input type="file"&gt;
                    element,
                    that generates a file browse button, but it's up to the
                    developer to
                    handle the incoming files.
                    The framework handles these "multipart" forms in a way
                    identical to building
                    normal forms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For an example of using the framework to create a simple
                    login form,
                    see the

                <p>
                    In addition to the form and bean interactions described
                    above,
                    The framework offers an additional facility to validate
                    the input
                    fields it has received.
                    To utilize this feature, override the following method in
                    your ActionForm
                    class:
                </p>

                <source><![CDATA[
validate(ActionMapping mapping,
HttpServletRequest request);

                <p>
                    The
                    <code>validate</code>
                    method is called by the controller servlet after
                    the bean properties have been populated, but before the
                    corresponding
                    action class's
                    <code>execute</code>
                    method is invoked.
                    The
                    <code>validate</code>
                    method has the following options:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        Perform the appropriate validations and find no
                        problems -- Return
                        either
                        <code>null</code>
                        or a zero-length ActionErrors instance,
                        and the controller servlet will proceed to call the
                        <code>execute</code>
                        method of the appropriate
                        <code>Action</code>
                        class.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Perform the appropriate validations and find problems
                        -- Return an
                        ActionErrors instance containing
                        <code>ActionMessage's,</code>
                        which
                        are classes that contain the error message keys (into
                        the
                        application's
                        <code>MessageResources</code>
                        bundle) that should be
                        displayed.
                        The controller servlet will store this array as a
                        request attribute
                        suitable for use by the
                        <code>&lt;html:errors&gt;</code>
                        tag, and
                        will forward control back to the input form
                        (identified by the
                        <code>input</code>
                        property for this
                        <code>ActionMapping</code>
                        ).
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, this feature is entirely optional.
                    The default implementation of the
                    <code>validate</code>
                    method returns
                    <code>null,</code>
                    and the controller servlet will assume that any
                    required validation is done by the action class.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One common approach is to perform simple, prima facia
                    validations using
                    the ActionForm
                    <code>validate</code>
                    method, and then handle the
                    "business logic" validation from the Action.

                <p>
                    The Struts Validator, covered in the next section, may be

                    Configuring the Validator to perform form validation is
                    easy.
                </p>
                <ol>

                    <li>
                        The ActionForm bean must extend ValidatorForm.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The form's JSP must include the
                        <a href="struts-html.html">&lt;html:javascript&gt;</a>
                        tag for client
                        side validation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You must define the validation rules in an xml file
                        like this:

                        <source><![CDATA[
<form-validation>
<formset>
<form name="logonForm">
  <field property="username" depends="required">
    <msg name="required" key="error.username"/>
  </field>
</form>
</formset>
</form-validation>
]]></source>
                        The msg element points to the message resource key to
                        use when generating the error message.
                    </li>
                    <li>Lastly, you must enable the ValidatorPlugin in the
                        struts-config.xml file like this:
                        <source><![CDATA[
<plug-in className="org.apache.struts.validator.ValidatorPlugIn">
<set-property
property="pathnames"

</plug-in>
]]></source>

                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong>
                    If your required form property is one of the Java object
                    representations of
                    primitive types (ie. java.lang.Integer), you must set the
                    ActionServlet's convertNull init.
                    parameter to true. Failing to do this will result in the
                    required validation not being performed
                    on that field because it will default to 0.

                <p>
                    Tiles is a powerful templating library that allows you to
                    construct views
                    by combining various "tiles".
                    Here's a quick setup guide:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Create a /layout/layout.jsp file that contains your
                        app's common look and
                        feel:

                        <source><![CDATA[
<html>
<body>
<tiles:insert attribute="body"/>
</body>
</html>
]]></source>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Create your /index.jsp homepage file:

                        <source><![CDATA[
<h1>This is my homepage</h1>
]]></source>

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Create a /WEB-INF/tiles-defs.xml file that looks like
                        this:

                        <source><![CDATA[
<tiles-definitions>
<definition
    name="layout"
    path="/layout/layout.jsp">
    <put name="body" value=""/>
</definition>
<definition name="homepage" extends="layout">
    <put
        name="body"
        value="/index.jsp"/>
</definition>
<tiles-definitions>
]]></source>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Setup the TilesPlugin in the struts-config.xml file:

                        <source><![CDATA[
<plug-in
    className="org.apache.struts.tiles.TilesPlugin">
    <set-property
        property="definitions-config"
        value="/WEB-INF/tiles-defs.xml"/>
</plug-in>
]]></source>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Setup an action mapping in struts-config.xml to point
                        to your
                        homepage tile:

                        <source><![CDATA[
<action
path="/index"
type="org.apache.struts.actions.ForwardAction"
parameter="homepage"/>
]]></source>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    The TilesPlugin configures a special RequestProcessor that
                    determines
                    if the requested view is a tile and processes it
                    accordingly.
                    Note that we made the homepage tile extend our root layout
                    tile and
                    changed the body attribute.
                    Tiles inserts the file named in the body attribute into
                    the main
                    layout.

                    completely
                    constructed based on the standard capabilities of
                    presentation libraries,
                    you may need to employ other techniques to render some
                    responses directly.

                <p>
                    Some applications require dynamically generated images,
                    like the
                    price charts on a stock reporting site.
                    Two different approaches are commonly used to meet these
                    requirements:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        Render a hyperlink with a URL that executes a servlet
                        request.
                        The servlet will use a graphics library to render the
                        graphical image,
                        set the content type appropriately (such as to
                        <code>image/gif</code>
                        ), and send back the bytes of that image to the
                        browser, which will display them just as if it had
                        received a static
                        file.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Render the HTML code necessary to download a Java
                        applet that
                        creates the required graph.
                        You can configure the graph by setting appropriate
                        initialization
                        parameters for the applet in the rendered code, or you
                        can have the
                        applet make its own connection to the server to
                        receive
                        these parameters.
                    </li>

                </ul>

            <subsection name="3.5.2 Rendering Text">

                <p>
                    Some applications require dynamically generated text or
                    markup,
                    such as XML.
                    If a complete page is being rendered, and can be output
                    using a
                    PrintWriter, this is very easy to do from an Action:
                </p>

                <source><![CDATA[
response.setContentType("text/plain"); // or text/xml
PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();
// use writer to render text
return(null);
]]></source>
