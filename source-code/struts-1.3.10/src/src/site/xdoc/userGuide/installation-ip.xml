                <h4 id="ipws60">iPlanet Application Server 6.0</h4>
                <p>Service Pack 2 is recommended.</p>
                <p>NOTE: At present, the Struts example application still uses
                    a non-Serializable
                    servlet context attribute, and will not run in an
                    environment that requires them,
                    like iPlanet Application Server.</p>
                <h4 id="ipws42">iPlanet Web Server 4.2</h4>
                <p>Here are the issues I ran into while moving my struts based
                    application from
                    Tomcat (supports WebApps and WAR) to iWS 4.1 (does
                    <strong>NOT</strong>
                    support Webapps
                    and WAR).
                </p>
                <p>Webapps and WAR will be supported in iWS 5.0, as mentioned
                    in iWS5.0 roadmap.</p>
                <h4>Classpath issues.</h4>
                <p>This s pretty straightforward. Since there is no notion of
                    <code>WEB-INF/lib</code>
                    and
                    <code>WEB-INF/classes</code>
                    the classpath has to be explicitly set in
                    <code>$SERVER_ROOT/config/jvm12.conf</code>
                    .
                </p>
                <h4>Context relative paths</h4>
                <p>All URLs should be visible from the document root. In my
                    case I just created
                    a symbolic link from
                    <code>$DOCROOT/myapp</code>
                    to
                    <code>webapps/myapp</code>
                    .
                </p>
                <h4>Extension mapping</h4>
                <p>The config file
                    <code>$SERVER_ROOT/config/rules.properties</code>
                    has a similar mechanism
                    as in web.xml.
                </p>
                <p>I have this in my
                    <code>rules.properties</code>
                    which forwards all urls ending with &quot;do&quot;
                    to the servlet whose logical name is action.
                </p>
