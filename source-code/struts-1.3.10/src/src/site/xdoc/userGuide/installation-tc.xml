                <h4 id="tc321">Tomcat 3.2.1 With Apache</h4>
                <p>Note that the instructions for Tomcat 4 will be different
                    than those for Tomcat 3,
                    but the Tomcat 4.0 web connector is still under
                    development. Versions of Tomcat prior
                    to 3.2.1 are not recommend for use with Struts.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>These instructions assume you have successfully
                        integrated Tomcat with Apache
                        according to the Tomcat documentation.</li>
                    <li>Copy "struts-documentation.war" and
                        "struts-example.war" to your $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps
                        directory</li>
                    <li>Restart Tomcat if it is already running</li>
                    <li>Tomcat will generate a file
                        "$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-apache.conf" that
                        will be used by Apache. This file is regenerated every
                        time you start Tomcat,
                        so copy this file to a safe place (such as your Apache
                        configuration directory;
                        on Unix systems this is usually
                        <code>/usr/local/apache/conf</code>
                        .
                    </li>
                    <li>If you are running Tomcat 3.1, Tomcat will not have
                        generated the entries
                        for your new applications. Add the following lines to
                        the
                        <code>tomcat-apache.conf</code>
                        file that you have saved, replacing $TOMCAT_HOME with
                        the path to your Tomcat
                        home directory:
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks

                    /struts-documentation
                    &lt;Location "/struts-documentation/WEB-INF/">

                    &lt;Location "/struts-example/WEB-INF/">
                    AllowOverride None
                    deny from all
                    &lt;/Location>
                </pre>
                <ul>
                    <li>The generated file above does not know anything
                        about extension mappings defined in a web.xml file, so
                        the "*.do" URIs that
                        go to the controller servlet will not be recognized.
                        To fix this, add the
                        following line to the saved version of
                        "tomcat-apache.conf", after the corresponding
                        line for the .jsp extension:
                        <br/>
                        <code>AddHandler jserv-servlet .do</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>Ensure that the saved version of "tomcat-apache.conf"
                        is referenced in your
                        Apache "httpd.conf" configuration file. A typical use
                        would have the following
                        line at the bottom of "httpd.conf":
                        <br/>
                        <code>Include
                            /usr/local/apache/conf/tomcat-apache.conf</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>In order to recognize "index.jsp" as a default page
                        for web applications,
                        search in your "httpd.conf" for a "DirectoryIndex"
                        directive. If you have
                        one, add "index.jsp" to the end of the list, so that
                        it might look like this:
                        <br/>
                        <code>DirectoryIndex index.html index.jsp</code>
                        <br/>
                        If you do not have such an entry, add one like this:
                        <br/>
                        <code>DirectoryIndex index.jsp</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>Restart Apache to make it aware of the new
                        applications. You should now
                        be able to access the applications from a browser like
                        this:
                        <br/>
                        <code>http://localhost/struts-documentation
                            <br/>
                            http://localhost/struts-example
                        </code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
