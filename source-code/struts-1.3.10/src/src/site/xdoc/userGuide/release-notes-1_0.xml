            <p>
                <strong>DEPRECATIONS</strong>
                - The entire custom tag library
                that is documented in
                <code>struts.tld</code>
                has been deprecated.
                These tags correspond to the Struts 0.5 functionality that is
                also
                deprecated, and have been replaced (and considerably enhanced)
                in
                the various individual tag libraries.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>DEPRECATIONS</strong>
                - The entire custom tag library
                that is documented in
                <code>struts-form.tld</code>
                has been deprecated
                because this library has been renamed
                <code>struts-html.tld</code>
                instead.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>DEPRECATIONS</strong>
                - Several classes in the
                <code>org.apache.struts.util</code>
                package have been marked as
                deprecated in their entirety, because they will be replaced by
                versions from the Jakarta Commons project once those packages
                are
                released. These deprecated classes will
                <strong>not</strong>
                be
                removed until a release after Struts 1.1. In general, the only
                change required inside user code using these classes will be
                to
                update the
                <code>import</code>
                statement. The following classes
                are involved:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>ArrayStack</li>
                <li>BeanUtils</li>

                <li>PropertyUtils</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The following new features have been added to the basic
                controller
                framework (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.action</code>
                ):

                ):
            </p>


            <p>The following new features have been added to the

                custom tag library (package
                <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.html</code>

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The
                    <code>&lt;html:link&gt;</code>
                    tag now supports the optional
                    <code>title</code>
                    attribute, that causes some browsers to display
                    alternate text when the mouse is hovered over a hyperlink.
                </li>
            </ul>

                    <code>indexId</code>
                    . This attribute names a page scope
                    attribute (and corresponding scripting variable) that will
                    be
                    exposed in the nested body of the iteration, which will
                    contain
                    the current loop index as a java.lang.Integer.
                </li>

            <p>The following changes and bug fixes have occurred in the basic

                <li>The instance variables in the

                    base class
                    are now transient, so that
                    <code>ActionForm</code>
                    instances can
                    actually be serialized.
                    <strong>WARNING</strong>
                    - If you deserialize
                    such an
                    <code>ActionForm</code>
                    instance and attempt to use it within
                    the Struts framework, be sure to call
                    <code>setServlet()</code>
                    (and
                    <code>setMultipartRequestHander()</code>
                    if appropriate) first.

            <p>The following changes and bug fixes have occurred in the file

                </li>
                <li>Fix operation ordering so that
                    <code>RequestUtils.lookup()</code>
                    will throw a JspException when the specified bean is

                </li>
                <li>Correct the calculation of an absolute URL from a

                    part of
                    the same web application), even if the current request is
                    maintaining
                    session identity with cookies. Previously, this only
                    worked if you

                    For example, generate

                    <code>checked="true"</code>
