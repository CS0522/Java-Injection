/**
 * Implementation of <strong>ActionMapping</strong> for the Struts
 * example application.  It defines the following custom properties:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>failure</b> - The context-relative URI to which this request
 *     should be forwarded if a validation error occurs on the input
 *     information (typically goes back to the input form).
 * <li><b>success</b> - The context-relative URI to which this request
 *     should be forwarded if the requested action is successfully
 *     completed.
 * </ul>
